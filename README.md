# Threads

This JAVA project uses thread and semaphores to run the execution concurrently. The project is basically executing based on the exam day. While Instructor hasn't arrived for the exam, Students will be asking to wait in front of class and they will be waiting in order (FCFS). 

Until Instructor arrives, students will get into class and take the test (using sleep())

The time will be shown in mini-second in floating point values.
